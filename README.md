# Lichess Custom Pieces
Is a firefox extension you can use locally to change the textures of the pieces on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/). You can replace the images of pieces in the ```./pieces``` folder with your custom images and they will be displayed on the lichess website.
## How to install the extension?
1. Go to ```about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox``` in your firefox
1. Click "Load temporary Add-on..."
1. Navigate to the ```manifest.json``` file on your computer
1. Go to [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/). (reload the page if needed)

After this, the pieces should have your custom textures.
